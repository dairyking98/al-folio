Hi, I'm **Leonard Chau**—a mechanical engineer, maker, and researcher from the San Francisco Bay Area. I specialize in building practical, low-cost scientific instruments that combine mechanical design, optics, electronics, automation, and software. I love working at the intersection of old and new technology: restoring typewriters and film equipment, welding and machining metal assemblies, and designing intelligent robotic systems powered by modern software and AI.

## Education & Background

I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at San Francisco State University (graduating Spring 2026, GPA 3.92). Before transferring, I studied engineering drawing, materials, calculus, physics, welding, metallurgy, and MATLAB at Diablo Valley College and Las Positas College, building a strong foundation in both engineering theory and hands-on fabrication.

I learned early that engineering isn't just math and simulation—it's the sound of a tool cutting material, the moment a prototype finally aligns, or the way a mechanical assembly "feels" when it works. That philosophy drives almost everything I build.

## Research & Innovation

My research focuses on democratizing access to advanced imaging and scientific tools. In Dr. Raymond Esquerra's Bioengineering Lab, I design robotic imaging systems—microscopes, fluorescence platforms, and depth-imaging tools—built from Raspberry Pi hardware, coaxial optics, dark-field illumination, and 3D-printed components. These systems cost a fraction of commercial instruments, yet deliver reliable, reproducible results for real experiments.

### Some of my projects:

**FluorCam**

A low-cost, open-source fluorescence and IR dark-field microscope.

- Uses coaxial optics, Raspberry Pi imaging, and custom Python automation

- Achieves fluorescence imaging comparable to commercial microscopes

- ~$500 total cost vs. $20,000+ commercial systems

- I led mechanical/optical design, integrating filters, mounts, gantry alignment, and automated acquisition

**StentorCam**

An automated dark-field platform for studying Stentor coeruleus behavior.

- 3D-printed optics + infrared illumination

- Automatic tracking and stimulation experiments

- Used for NSF-funded training and team research

**3D-Cam**

A depth-imaging platform using a single camera and mirror geometry.

- Performs z-height reconstruction without dual-camera hardware

- I lead the mechanical design and software development in Python

- Currently under active development

Across these systems, my work combines CAD, optics, G-code automation, Python, image processing, and mechanical iteration to transform research ideas into working instruments.

This research has led to:

- Poster and oral presentations at the Gilead Scholars Symposium, Student Enrichment Office Research Symposium, and Center for Cellular Construction Summer Retreat

- Funding awards including the Gilead Innovation Initiative and Kenneth Fong Translational Research Award

## Hands-On Engineering

My engineering identity is fundamentally physical and practical.

I've worked as a TIG welder and fabricator at Altamont Manufacturing, building precision metal assemblies from drawings under strict quality requirements. At SFSU, I work as an Engineering Machine Shop Assistant, supporting students in machining, 3D printing, and lab equipment setup. As VP of the 3D Printing Club and VP of Tau Beta Pi, I mentor peers, run workshops, and maintain the Innovation Space as an open, accessible fabrication environment.

I've restored and reverse-engineered mechanical devices ranging from motorcycles and radios to antique typewriters. One long-term project involves designing parametric, resin-printed replacement type elements using OpenSCAD—preserving historical machines while exploring new fonts and mechanical geometries.

Whether in a machine shop, lab bench, or CAD environment, I enjoy solving problems where theory becomes hardware.

## Technical Focus

- **Mechanical design** (Fusion 360, SolidWorks, OpenSCAD)

- **3D printing** (FDM + SLA), camera/optical mounts, alignment systems

- **Welding**: TIG, MIG, flux core; machining and fabrication

- **Python & C++** automation, image processing, G-code motion control

- **Experimental design**, quantitative imaging, biological assays

- **Diagnostics and repair** of mechanical and electrical systems

- **Using AI tools** to accelerate design, optimization, and coding

## Why I Build

I believe engineering is a blend of science, art, and restoration. I love old machines not just because they are nostalgic, but because they remind us that clever mechanisms existed before microprocessors. I love new technology because AI, embedded control, and digital fabrication let us reinvent what is possible at low cost.

My goal is to design accessible, open-source instruments—tools that make research more affordable, education more hands-on, and experimentation more precise.

If you're working on imaging, robotics, mechanical restoration, scientific instrumentation, or unusual electromechanical systems—let's build something together.
